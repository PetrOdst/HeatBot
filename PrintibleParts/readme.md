# Printible Parts

![this is how it should looks](https://github.com/PetrOdst/YodaHeatBot/blob/9296d73e1bdaa9fa9b6e57d5e98c530665e0479c/PrintibleParts/heatbot.jpg)

Try to keep parts orientation as shown to avoid supports usage.
In my case:
  - Layer hight 0.2
  - infill 15%
  - no supports
  - no Brim
Worked  fine.
